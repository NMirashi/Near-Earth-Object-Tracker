# Near Earth Object Tracker

### What was the purpose of this site? 

<div style="text-align: justify">With the rise of companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin, large volumes of data are being collected to cater for the growing interest in space travel of the general public. There exists several sites and resources that showcase these explorations and findings. However, despite being incredibly well documented and detailed, these sites lack engagement. Using NASA's vast collection of API's, we aspire to create a site that is both interactive and informative, presenting data about near-Earth Objects (NEOs). This will make the information interesting, especially for younger users keen on learning more about space exploration.</div>

### Where is the hosted site?

All pages of the site were hosted on infinityfree servers with some embedded pages that would be hosted on a flask server. The flask server (for the chat) would need to be run locally at this stage.
